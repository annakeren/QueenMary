%% In order to run the transformation examples of the course work,
% you are to open transformation.m script that contains all 
%the functions combinations.
%% There are two functions: ICV_rotate and ICV_skew
%Both get two arguments: absolute path to the image and angle
%Note that if the file is coloured then it is to converted to grayscale
%this conversion is provided in the script
%
%
%Please edit the following variable in the script:
%rotationAngle=30;
%skewingAngle=60;
%path = '/some/path/transformation.jpg';

%Uncomment the relevant sections, for example,
%if you need to rotate only, uncomment the following lines
%%%just rotate, uncommenct to see the result
%%rotatedMatrix = ICV_rotate(imageMatrix, rotationAngle);
%%imshow(rotatedMatrix)
