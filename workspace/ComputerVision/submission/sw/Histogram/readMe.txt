%% In order to run Histogram code, there is a script, histogram.m, provided.
%This script contains all the examples need to fullfil the course work task.
% 
%There is ICV_getFramesFromAVI function that gets one argument, path
%to the video avi file, please edit this variable in the script before running.
%
%Further in the sript there is a for loop that runs through all the frames
%returned by ICV_getFramesFromAVI.
%Please edit frame two index constants in order to get histograms of two
%desired frames:
%if frameIndex == 201%edit this constant

%Uncomment lines that contain function call to ICV_visualizeHistogram,
%in order to see histograms visualizations.

%The results presented in the report are not normalized, although 
%there is a part in the code that normalizes it. Comment the for loop
%below "%normalize the intersections" comment in file ICV_getIntersection.m
%in order to see unnormalized
%results.
