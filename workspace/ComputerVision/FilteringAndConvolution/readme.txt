%In order to run eamples of Filtering and Convolution task of course work,
%there is a script provided, filteringAndConvolution.m. this script has 
%all the kernels and function calls to run all the examples. You are to 
%uncomment the desired part of the script, for example:
%
%% %run on designed kernel 3x3
% filteredMatrixDesigned = ICV_filterImage(imageMatrixGray,kernelMatrixDesinged);
% imshow(filteredMatrixDesigned)
%
%There is a path variable in the script that needs to be set to your coloured
%image. If the image that you wish to provide is gray scale, then
%imageMatrixGray = rgb2gray(imageMatrixColoured);
%is to be changed to imageMatrixGray = imageMatrixColoured;
